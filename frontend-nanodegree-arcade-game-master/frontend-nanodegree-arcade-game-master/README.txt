For playing the game:

First download all the game files. You should keep the folder structure as is. To start the game open index.html in your browser.


Game rules:

Player has three lives. Every time the player collides with a bug, he/she loses a life. When the number of lives reaches 0, the game is over and it gets reloaded. 

Player can move in any direction, on any terrain except on water. Bugs only move on stones on the x axis with variant speeds. All the bugs (in different color) have the same rules for interacting with the player, when a bug and the player collide, player loses one life.

When player collects gems, the score is bumped up by 10 points for each one. When player reaches the water the score is bumped up by 5 points each time. When the score reaches 100 points, a key appears. In order to finish the game the player must collect the key. At that point the game is over, player won, and the game reloads.

Have fun! :)
